# YouDL

A desktop-based application that manages downloaded YouTube videos, allowing users to play, rename, delete and view the details of the video. In addition, users can download a video with their desired formatting settings, such as the frame rate, format, resolution, and file location. Downloads are stored in a SQLite database, in order to access the media files.
